Hi! In my Computational Biology class, we learned the ins and outs of R studio. R studio is a great way to organize large sets of data quickly, while also giving you the opportunity to visualize your data in fully customizable plots and charts.

One cool thing about R studio is the ability to intertwine your R code with code from other languages such as Python. Although R is generally more user-friendly and easier to grasp, some people prefer to incorporate python code due to its popularity within the coding community.

Here is an example of a Python string operation being used in R studio:

```{python}
one = "Hello"
two = "there"
one + two

```
Simply using {python} at the top of the code chunk lets you use python in your R markdown!

Now I will demonstrate and example of Python interacting with R using the "reticulate" package:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
first <- "This is code from R and"
```

```{python}
second = "this is code from python!"

```
In this next line, we will be accessing the python-defined objects in the python code above, but printing it through our R script.
```{r}
cat(c(first,py$second))
```

There are many other ways to allow these two languages to play with each other, but these are just some of the basics. Pretty neat right?!
