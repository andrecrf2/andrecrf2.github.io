      <description>Hi! In my Computational Biology class, we learned the ins and outs of R studio. R studio is a great way to organize large sets of data quickly, while also giving you the opportunity to visualize your data in fully customizable plots and charts.
One cool thing about R studio is the ability to intertwine your R code with code from other languages such as Python. Although R is generally more user-friendly and easier to grasp, some people prefer to incorporate python code due to its popularity within the coding community.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (preferably HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (ideally HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).
The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output.</description>
